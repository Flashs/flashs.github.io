This is my first blog post... ever. 
I have read blogs in the past, but i wouldn't really call myself a blog connoisseur to be fair. 
The main reason I want to get started with blogging is getting better at expressing myself. Obviously I have done some research beforehand, on how to start blogging, what to blog about and what plattform to choose. As with everthing the most mentioned advice is: Just do it. 

Just do it, every journey starts with the first step, etc. Thinking about it, there are a lot, maybe even a hilarious amount, of tipps which basically express the same thought. 

So here am i. Doing my first steps, and talking you along with me. The themes you can expect me to blog about are:

* Embedded Things - I love them. Embedded things were the things that got me into computer science. Combining the magic of programming and the real world, the physics. Turning on a LED, making those electrons move. What a magic moment. The same amount of joy you get, when following a complicated guide, copy-and-pasting commands, without any feedback if it worked or if it did anything at all. And then... it works. This one in a million case. _Anyhow, I'm getting carried away, back to the list, that i might block about._ 
* Rust
