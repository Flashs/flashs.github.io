This is my first blog post... ever. 
I have read blogs in the past, but i wouldn't really call myself a blog connoisseur to be fair. 
The main reason I want to get started with blogging is getting better at expressing myself.
Obviously I have done some research beforehand, on how to start blogging, what to blog about and what platform to choose.
As with everything the most mentioned advice is: Just do it. 

Just do it, every journey starts with the first step, etc. Thinking about it, there are a lot, maybe even a hilarious amount, of advices which basically express the same thought. 

So here am I.
Doing my first steps, and talking you along with me.
The topics you can expect me to blog about are:

* Embedded Things - 
I love them. 
Embedded things were the things that got me into computer science. 
Combining the magic of programming and the real world, the physics. 
Turning on a LED, making those electrons move. 
What a magic moment. 
The same amount of joy you get, when following a complicated guide, copy-and-pasting commands, without any feedback if it worked or if it did anything at all. 
And then... it works. 
This one in a million case. 
_Anyhow, I'm getting carried away, back to the list, that I might blog about._ 

* Rust - 
I am not even sure how or when I had discovered rust the first time. I remember being on [/r/programming](reddit.com/r/programming) and getting the feeling, that everyone was mentioning rust and Haskell. This is maybe 3-4 years ago. Since then, I have touched Haskell and started to like rust. Every few months I think to myself: I should start rust / do a project in rust. But until today, I have not really implemented anything noteworthy in rust, but I really enjoy the way rust forces you to think of ownership and architecture from right off the bat. 

* dotnet -
So, I am really not sure how dotnet fits this whole story.
Rust and embedded things may be connected, but dotnet?
Well, i think I've first came across dotnet with dotnet core 1.0, a huge deal for me since I was using Linux back then.
So there it was, a language/runtime, cross-platform and in my (back then) opinion better than Java. 
Java is the language I have first learned and always found mediocre. 
It was not exiting and doing UI-Stuff always looked ... meh.
This turns out to be more of my fault.
Looking back i have not made a single eye pleasing user-interface.
The more and more I use Linux, the more I tell myself that console interfaces are superior anyway.
I know they're not. There are places for them, and there are even more places not for them. _Back to topic_. 
Dotnet was appealing enough for me to try it out, and I like it. I've yet to develop anything huge with it, but every time I use it, I'm in joy. No worries about ownership, passing data, reading cryptic linker errors, breaking my head over crashing microcontrollers, without any apparent reason.


A little heads up: My next project and therefore my next posts will address dotnet full-stack with angular. Maybe. Hopefully.

See you then.
